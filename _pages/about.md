I am a writer of code and prose!
Professionally, I have over four years of experience as a full stack software engineer on collaborative engineering teams. 

As passionate about communicating as I am about coding, I excel at deeply understanding the needs of management, clients, and users across all levels of technical proficiency.

I'm particularly interested and experienced in back end development, especially using Java and the JVM ecosystem (including Spring and Groovy/Grails). 
I am also skilled in Ruby on Rails and API development in general. 

I have worked across the fintech, government contracting, and healthcare industries, and am always excited to immerse myself in a new technology or field.
