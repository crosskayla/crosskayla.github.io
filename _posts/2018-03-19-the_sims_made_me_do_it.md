*The 2000s was a productive waste of time for me.*

For a nerdy girl in an itinerant family, the internet was a godsend. I moved around a lot from school to school, and the internet was always a click away - I could take it all with me. I also respected the technology community’s ethos - however apocryphal - that it wasn’t about who you were, but what you could do. Most comforting was the [culture around early online games](https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/neopets-a-look-into-early-2000s-girl-culture-w509885) and the freedom they gave me, and kids like me, to create our own little worlds.

Take Neopets. The first time I used html and css was to deck out my Neopets store with my own custom template. I can’t remember the exact details of the layout, but I’m sure it kept up with the chicest [Geocities](http://https://gizmodo.com/5983574/remember-the-hilarious-horror-of-geocities-with-this-website) design [trends](http://http://www.cameronsworld.net/) of the time. (Warning: the latter link has autoplay music - but that should be self-evident. I said Geocities.)

And The Sims! The possibilities within the default builds seemed endless, but when I found out there was custom content on top of that? And that I could make my own if I only knew how? And that knowing how was a few tutorials away? I modded every release of those games and felt like I’d hit the motherlode. (Speaking of Geocities, if my blog had an autoplay mp3, it would be The Sims' [loading music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvDS6hRzN8k).)

My small additions to these games thrilled me because there were so many possibilities. I rarely ever had trouble with writer’s block - I got excited at the blankness of the page because it meant I could write. It turns out the same went for the emptiness of a bright, blinking screen or a console when I was starting a project - it meant I could make something.

Much later, I took a Ruby class in college and rediscovered my love for coding. Then I took a C++ class and lost it again. :) Regardless, as I was taking stock of my experience at school before I graduated at the end of last year, I noticed that the only time I lost track of time while doing schoolwork was when working on coding and writing projects. So I decided to commit myself to pursuing it - not just because it means a lot of time I enjoyed wasting in my youth wouldn’t be, well, wasted - but because it’s been a constant passion throughout my life. One that I want to continue until I’m old enough to explain to younger generations what it was like before artificially intelligent Sims.
